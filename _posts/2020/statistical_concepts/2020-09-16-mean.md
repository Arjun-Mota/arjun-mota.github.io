## Concept

Mean or Average is used widely in machine learning starting from algorithms to evaluation and optimizations. It is simply an average of a set of values. It is usually denoted by <span class="inline_equation">\\(\bar{x}\\)</span> (x bar). Let's understand the formula and an example.

## Formula

<span class="centered_equation">
\$\$
\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}\right)=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}}{n}
\$\$
</span>

Here <span class="inline_equation">\\( \sum \\)</span> = symbol for doing summation of values,<br/>
x is a value from a table, dataset, or simply from a set of values,<br/>
n is a number of values in a table, dataset, or set of values.

## Explanation

You might have got it already, we are simply doing a sum of all the values and diving it by the number of values. The result of this computation is a mean or an average of all the values.<br/>

It is used in different evaluation metrics and machine learning algorithms. Let's jump on to one example quickly.

## Example

|x|
|-:|
|10.3|
|25.7|
|15.8|
|12.5|
|-2.2|
|22.1|
|11.2|
|3.6|
|4.6|
|Î£ = 103.6|

<br/>

Here in this table n = 9<br/>

Putting it in our formula:<br/>

<span class="centered_equation">
\$\$
\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}\right)=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}}{n}
\$\$
</span>

<span class="centered_equation">
\$\$
\bar{x}=\frac{103.6}{9} = 11.51
\$\$
</span>

11.51 will be our mean of all the values from a table.
