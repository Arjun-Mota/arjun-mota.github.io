## Concept

Mode is a statistical concept of finding a number that is repeated the most from the series of numbers. It is useful in understanding the repetativeness of a certain data point in dataset. Let us understand the concept by example.

## Explanation

To find a mode, we first need to sort the data and then take a frequency of each unique number from a series. The number with the highest frequency would be the mode of a series.

## Example

|x|
|-:|
| 38 |
| 8 |
| 32 |
| 4 |
| 11 |
| 33 |
| 43 |
| 20 |
| 14 |
| 38 |
| 9 |

<br/>After sorting all the values:<br/>

<b>4, 8, 9, 11, 14, 20, 32, 33, 38, 38, 43</b><br/>

Now, from this sorted series, if we calculate a frequency of all the numbers, we will get our mode as 38. Because 38 has occurred twice in this series. Therefore 38 would be considered as a mode of the series.<br/>

There is also a possibility of having more than 1 mode. If a series contains 2 modes it is called bimodal, for 3 it is trimodal and for 4 and more modes it is called a multimodal.
